    cd <your-repository-directory>
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install

3.  **Create a `.env` file** in the root of the project and add your credentials:
    ```env
    GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id.apps.googleusercontent.com
    GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
    REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:5000/auth/callback
    GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key

## üîë Authentication Flow

Before using the API endpoints, you must authenticate.

1.  Make sure the server is running.
2.  Open your web browser and navigate to:
    **`http://localhost:5000/auth/google`**
3.  Log in with your Google account and grant the requested permissions.
4.  You will be redirected back and see a success message. Your server now has the necessary tokens to make API calls. **You must repeat this step every time you restart the server.**
